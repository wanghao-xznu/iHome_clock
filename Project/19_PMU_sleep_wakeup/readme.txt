  This example is based on the GD32307C-EVAL-V1.0 board, it shows how pmu enter sleep mode 
and how to wakeup it. After power-on, all the LEDs are off. The mcu will enter sleep 
mode and the software stop running. When the USART0 receives a byte of data from the 
hyperterminal, the mcu will be wakeup from a receive interrupt. And all the leds will 
spark.
  
  JP5 must be fitted.
