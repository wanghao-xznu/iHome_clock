  This demo is based on the GD32307C-EVAL-V1.0 board, it shows how to use USART0 transmit 
and receive interrupts to communicate with the hyperterminal.
  Firstly, USART0 sends the strings to the hyperterminal and still waits for receiving 
data from the hyperterminal. Then, compare tx_buffer with the rx_buffer, if the tx_buffer 
is the same with the rx_buffer, LED2, LED3, LED4, LED5 light by turns. Otherwise, LED2, LED3, 
LED4£¬LED5 toggle together.
